# 🛡️ Node9 Proxy

### The "Sudo" Command for AI Agents.

**Node9** is the execution security layer for the Agentic Era. It encases autonomous AI Agents (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor, MCP Servers) in a deterministic security wrapper, intercepting dangerous shell commands and tool calls before they execute.

While others try to _guess_ if a prompt is malicious (Semantic Security), Node9 _governs_ the actual action (Execution Security).

## 💎 The "Aha!" Moment

**AIs are literal.** When you ask an agent to "Fix my disk space," it might decide to run `docker system prune -af`.

**With Node9, the interaction looks like this:**

1. **🤖 AI attempts a "Nuke":** `Bash("docker system prune -af --volumes")`
2. **🛡️ Node9 Intercepts:** An OS-native popup appears immediately.
3. **🛑 User Blocks:** You click "Block" in the popup.
4. **🧠 AI Negotiates:** Node9 explains the block to the AI. The AI responds: _"I understand. I will pivot to a safer cleanup, like removing only large log files instead."_

## ⚡ Key Architectural Upgrades

### 🏁 The Multi-Channel Race Engine

Node9 initiates a **Concurrent Race** across all enabled channels. The first channel to receive a human signature wins and instantly cancels the others:

- **Native Popup:** OS-level dialog (Mac/Win/Linux) for sub-second keyboard dismissal.
- **Browser Dashboard:** Local web UI for deep inspection of large payloads (SQL/Code).
- **Cloud (Slack):** Remote asynchronous approval for team governance.
- **Terminal:** Classic `[Y/n]` prompt for manual proxy usage and SSH sessions.

### 🧠 AI Negotiation Loop

Node9 doesn't just "cut the wire." When a command is blocked, it injects a **Structured Negotiation Prompt** back into the AI’s context window. This teaches the AI why it was stopped and instructs it to pivot to a safer alternative or apologize to the human.

### ⏪ Shadow Git Snapshots (Auto-Undo)

Node9 takes a silent, lightweight Git snapshot before every AI file edit. If the AI hallucinates and breaks your code, run `node9 undo` to instantly revert — with a full diff preview before anything changes.

```bash
# Undo the last AI action (shows diff + asks confirmation)
node9 undo

# Go back N actions at once
node9 undo --steps 3
```

Example output:

```
⏪  Node9 Undo
    Tool:  str_replace_based_edit_tool → src/app.ts
    When:  2m ago
    Dir:   /home/user/my-project

--- src/app.ts (snapshot)
+++ src/app.ts (current)
@@ -1,4 +1,6 @@
-const x = 1;
+const x = 99;
+const y = "hello";

Revert to this snapshot? [y/N]
```

Node9 keeps the last 10 snapshots. Snapshots are only taken for file-writing tools (`write_file`, `edit_file`, `str_replace_based_edit_tool`, `create_file`) — not for read-only or shell commands.

### 🌊 The Resolution Waterfall

Security posture is resolved using a strict 5-tier waterfall:

1.  **Env Vars:** Session-level overrides (e.g., `NODE9_PAUSED=1`).
2.  **Cloud (SaaS):** Global organization "Locks" that cannot be bypassed locally.
3.  **Project Config:** Repository-specific rules (`node9.config.json`).
4.  **Global Config:** Personal UI preferences (`~/.node9/config.json`).
5.  **Defaults:** The built-in safety net.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
npm install -g @node9/proxy

# 1. Setup protection for your favorite agent
node9 addto claude
node9 addto gemini

# 2. Initialize your local safety net
node9 init

# 3. Check your status
node9 status
```

## 🛠 Protection Modes

| Mode            | Target                 | How it works                                            |
| :-------------- | :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Hook Mode**   | Claude, Gemini, Cursor | `node9 addto <agent>` wires native pre-execution hooks. |
| **Proxy Mode**  | MCP Servers, Shell     | `node9 "npx <server>"` intercepts JSON-RPC traffic.     |
| **Manual Mode** | You                    | `node9 rm -rf /` protects you from your own typos.      |

## ⚙️ Configuration (`node9.config.json`)

Rules are **merged additive**—you cannot "un-danger" a word locally if it was defined as dangerous by a higher authority (like the Cloud).

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "mode": "standard",
    "enableUndo": true,
    "approvers": {
      "native": true,
      "browser": true,
      "cloud": true,
      "terminal": true
    }
  },
  "policy": {
    "sandboxPaths": ["/tmp/**", "**/test-results/**"],
    "dangerousWords": ["drop", "destroy", "purge", "push --force"],
    "ignoredTools": ["list_*", "get_*", "read_*"],
    "toolInspection": {
      "bash": "command",
      "postgres:query": "sql"
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**`node9 check` exits immediately / Claude is never blocked**
Node9 fails open by design to prevent breaking your agent. Check debug logs: `NODE9_DEBUG=1 claude`.

**Terminal prompt never appears during Claude/Gemini sessions**
Interactive agents run hooks in a "Headless" subprocess. You **must** enable `native: true` or `browser: true` in your config to see approval prompts.

**"Blocked by Organization (SaaS)"**
A corporate policy has locked this action. You must click the "Approve" button in your company's Slack channel to proceed.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [x] **Multi-Channel Race Engine** (Simultaneous Native/Browser/Cloud/Terminal)
- [x] **AI Negotiation Loop** (Instructional feedback loop to guide LLM behavior)
- [x] **Resolution Waterfall** (Cascading configuration: Env > Cloud > Project > Global)
- [x] **Native OS Dialogs** (Sub-second approval via Mac/Win/Linux system windows)
- [x] **Shadow Git Snapshots** (1-click Undo for AI hallucinations)
- [x] **Identity-Aware Execution** (Differentiates between Human vs. AI risk levels)
- [ ] **Execution Sandboxing** (Simulate dangerous commands in a virtual FS before applying)
- [ ] **Multi-Admin Quorum** (Require 2+ human signatures for high-stakes production actions)
- [ ] **SOC2 Tamper-proof Audit Trail** (Cryptographically signed, cloud-managed logs)
